# Portfolio - React

This is a simple developer portfolio project built using React and Chakra UI, implemented with Formik for form handling. It showcases the work, projects, certificates, and contact information of a developer. The portfolio is divided into four sections: Greeting, Projects, Certificates, and Contact Form.

## Sections

### Greeting Section

The Greeting section is the first section of the portfolio. It welcomes visitors and provides a brief introduction to the developer. It may include a profile picture, a tagline, and a short description highlighting the developer's skills and expertise.

### Projects Section

The Projects section displays a collection of the developer's projects. Each project is represented by a card or tile, providing details such as project name, description, technologies used, and a link to the project's repository or live demo. This section showcases the developer's programming abilities and demonstrates their previous work.

### Certificates Section

The Certificates section showcases the developer's certifications and achievements. It can include certificates earned from online courses, workshops, or any other relevant qualifications. Each certificate may be displayed with its name, issuer, and a link to verify its authenticity.

### Contact Form Section

The Contact Form section allows visitors to get in touch with the developer. It includes a form created using Formik, where users can enter their name, email address, and message. This section enables potential clients or collaborators to reach out easily and establish a connection.
